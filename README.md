## Overview

- The main purpose of the app was for [Mufteey](https://x.com/Mustee__jr) to be able to share his best work, this made me explore the world of CMSs. My friend and mentor [Ridollah](https://x.com/esinnation) recommended I explore sanity.
- The Portfolio should also be able to change themes dynamically
